# Lessgo Hugo


## How i approched the task:

This was an interesting but also a confusing task.I faced many issues on my way, but able to solve somehow, definitely with the help og google. Nevertheless, i was happy to see the result.

Here are the steps i followed to complete the task:

### Step 1:
- I installed hugo using the terminal command 
> snap install hugo
- Meanwhile i also selected the theme i'll be using to build my portfolio.

### Step 2:
- Created a directory for the portfolio
> hugo new site portfolio

### Step 3:
- Moved into the portfolio dir.
- Clone the repository of the theme from hugo into this folder.
> git clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1
- I chose the **PaperMod** theme from hugo.
- Add **theme='PaperMod'** inside the *hugo.toml* file

### Step 4:
- Adding necessary changes to hugo.toml to create changes in the portfolio.
- Adding required photos and contents for the Portfolio.
